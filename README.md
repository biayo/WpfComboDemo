# WpfComboDemo

`This is a work in progress, as in, I'm still trying to catch up with my available time :D`

## The idea
Trying to bind a couple of comboboxes with a remote service (in this case, the FakeService class) and show a webview with some url from the selected entity.

## The implementation
Tried my best to use the MVVM pattern without any nuget package that could make things easier (like heroes we die!)
